# First-Project

For our Cocktail Wonderland Project, we used 2 different APIs.

Also as one of the requirements, we have Materialize as our css framework. 

User Story: 
As someone who enjoys adult beverages and wants to try new cocktails, I want to have some options for cocktails and see some fun facts while doing it. 

Acceptance criteria: 

When user clicks on cocktail randomizer, they hear a shaker sound. They get a random cocktail displaying the name and its recipe. 

When user interacts with "Make a cocktail" card; when they choose an alcohol from the dropdown options and click "Get Cocktails",they are presented with 5 possible cocktail choices with the chosen alcohol. They can hover over the list and choose one, that will display a recipe for that chosen cocktail. They can go back by clicking the "Go Back" button and choose another cocktail from that list. 

When user clicks the 'Click Me' button on "Fun Fact" card, they are presented with a random Chuck Norris "fact". They can click again to get a new one.
